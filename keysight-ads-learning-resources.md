03. [ADS Layout Design - Keysight - 20160802](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtq84kH8xZ9EY2QSdnUwpM7eZxc9VMtw0)
> Generally speaking, your designs begin in the schematic view. However, when you're taping out your designs, you will need to translate your circuit to a physical design in the layout view. This playlist covers the details and intricacies in the ADS Layout design. We look at different design methodologies, as well as numerous tricks and tips to improve your designing technique. The layout overview series (marked with the [Layout Overview] tag) in particular covers two different common design tasks, while demonstrating a number of fundamental drawing tasks in layout.

> In contrast to traditional electronics, which is all about handling data, power electronics is all about handling power: generating it, converting it, and moving it from source to load. This technology finds applications in a wide range of industries including power utility generation and distribution; automotive; and consumer electronics.

> The fast dV/dt edges of modern switched-mode converters that benefit from SiC and GaN transistors require new thinking about EDA tools. Keysight EEsof EDA’s products including Advanced Design System (ADS) and Electromagnetic Professional (EMPro) offer are tools that offer solutions for design and simulation of power electronics.
